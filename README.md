A Flask application that uses python with sqlalchemy to create, update, and maintain a database for basic e-commerce functionality.

Models were created for Customers, Products, Orders, and Customer Accounts to facilitate database integration into the Flask app.

Routes were created for each model with basic CRUD operations, and they were tested using Postman.

MySQL Workbench was used to check the tables and columns created, and to verify foreign keys and relationships.

I have a little more work to do, so not everything is working as of 11/14/24. I will continue to update, and I will be re-submitting the assignment when I believe it is 100%.
